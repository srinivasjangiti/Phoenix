# diagnose-runner.ps1 - automated, crash-resilient hang hunt.
#
# The problem with running the stress phases by hand is that a hang destroys the
# test along with the machine. So this keeps its state on disk and re-enters
# itself from the Startup folder after every reboot:
#
#   - marks a phase "running" BEFORE starting it and flushes to disk
#   - if it starts up and finds a phase still marked "running", that phase
#     HUNG the machine. That is the result we want, recorded automatically.
#   - otherwise it marks the phase "survived" and moves to the next
#   - when every phase is done it writes a verdict and disarms itself
#
# Net effect: fire once, walk away, read the verdict. A hang no longer loses data,
# it IS the data.

$ErrorActionPreference = 'Continue'

# Single-instance guard. Without this, a delayed Startup-folder launch can race a
# running instance: the newcomer sees the phase the live instance just marked
# "running" and mis-reports it as HUNG. Only one runner may exist at a time.
