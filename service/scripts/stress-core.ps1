# stress-core.ps1 - try to reproduce the hang ON DEMAND, and pin down whether
# the failing P-core is responsible.
#
# WHEA says every corrected parity error is on APIC 8 and 9, which are the two
# hyperthreads of ONE physical P-core. So instead of a generic all-core burn,
# we can load that core SPECIFICALLY and compare it against the healthy ones:
#
#   -Target Bad    load ONLY logical CPUs 8,9   (the degraded core)
#   -Target Good   load everything EXCEPT 8,9   (the healthy cores)
#   -Target All    load everything
#
# If Bad hangs the machine and Good runs clean for the same duration, that is
# as close to proof as we can get without a parts swap. If BOTH run clean,
# the hang is probably not load-driven and we look at drivers or RAM instead.
#
# A heartbeat is flushed to disk every few seconds. If the machine hangs, the
# last heartbeat tells us exactly how long it survived and under what load.
#
# WARNING: this is DESIGNED to provoke a hang. Save your work first.

# up with 3 workers instead of 30 and a worthless control run. A plain interpreter
# loop is less efficient per thread but pegs it just as hard and always starts.

# case-insensitively against the "Seconds" inside "AddSeconds" - every worker got
