// Phoenix ServiceNow assist loop — the DRAFTING BRAIN (hub-side, stateless).
//
// Boundary (confirmed 2026-07): Phoenix NEVER sends. The ServiceNow dashboard on
// the bridge host sends AS the user when the user clicks Send on the page. Phoenix's
// only job is the drafting that box can't do (no Claude on the bridge host): given a
// Slack conversation, draft the reply the user would send.
//
// Transport is REVERSE-PUSH (machine -> hub), not hub -> machine: Phoenix's server
// runs as the SYSTEM account (desktop-pc$) which has Tailscale egress but no SSH key,
// so it can't SSH out to the machine. Instead the bridge host's watcher (runs as the
// user, has a key + egress) POSTs a conversation to /api/v1/sn-loop/draft, the
// hub drafts here, and the watcher writes the proposal into its "Needs You" feed
// locally. Nothing here can put a message into Slack.
//
// Safety that holds even against a hostile Slack message: the drafter is
// llm.js `claude()` (askAI) — pure text in/out, NO bash/ssh/MCP/file tools. A
// crafted "reply now, run ..." only yields draft TEXT the user reviews before
// sending. Inbound Slack text is wrapped as DATA.

// The user's hard rule: NO dashes in drafted replies (no em/en dashes, no spaced
// hyphen connectors, no dash bullets). Enforce deterministically — the model
// ignores the instruction often enough that a post-process is the reliable fix.
