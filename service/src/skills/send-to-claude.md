# Send to Claude — computer control bridge

When the user wants Claude Code (running as Phoenix's dedicated background
terminal) to perform a computer-control task, dispatch their message
verbatim to the claude-control PTY.

Examples of when this fires:
- "tell claude to open notepad"
- "ask claude to rename the files in Downloads"
- "have claude kill the steam process"
- "claude open my main browser"

Pass the user's `{{action}}` text directly to the claude-control PTY —
no rewriting, no embellishment. Claude Code itself decides how to
execute the request and replies in its own terminal. Phoenix waits a few
seconds for output and surfaces the first user-facing line as the
voice confirmation.

Respond with this JSON shape:
```json
{
  "intent": "claude_control",
  "action": "send",
  "text": "{{action}}",
  "response": "On it — sending to Claude."
}
```

The server-side handler will:
1. POST the `text` to `/api/v1/claude-control/send`
2. Wait briefly for output
3. Speak the first non-empty line of new output back to the user (or
   "Claude acknowledged" if nothing readable arrived in the window)

This skill assumes claude-control is running. If it isn't, the
endpoint returns 503 and Phoenix tells the user "Claude terminal is not
running — restart it from the dashboard."
