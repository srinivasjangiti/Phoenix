## Known Issues
- Copy-paste into terminal input still broken (Ctrl+V doesn't inject text correctly)
- Device status stale — showing 'off' when connected
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) not working on dashboard
- Terminal losing messages when Claude is executing tools in parallel
- 'Phoenix remembers' briefing disappears if user switches tabs during session start

## Recently Fixed (Remove After Dream Cycle Runs)
- Chat input Enter key behavior (now sends message, no newlines) ✓
- Approvals tab UI (added, responsive, flashing) ✓
- Device section separation (now shows devices separately from core services) ✓
- AHK startup on reboot (fixed via Phoenix.bat + Steward launch) ✓
- Alt+D hotkey for terminal/chat toggle ✓


## Verification Status
- Items in Known Issues must be verified reproducible in current conversation before next session
- 'Recently Fixed' items require explicit user confirmation and timestamp before moving to 'What Works'
- If memory contradicts conversation, conversation is source-of-truth
- Task re-appears as open issue = memory consolidation failure, not task incompleteness
