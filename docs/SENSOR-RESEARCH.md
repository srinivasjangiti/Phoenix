# Phoenix Sensor Catalog

Complete list of known sensing modalities, categorized by size and feasibility for wearable integration.

## Human Senses (True External Sensors)
These detect stimuli from the external environment:

| # | Sense | What It Detects |
|---|-------|----------------|
| 1 | Vision | Electromagnetic radiation (visible light, ~380-700nm) |
| 2 | Hearing | Sound pressure waves (~20Hz-20kHz) |
| 3 | Smell (olfaction) | Airborne chemical molecules |
| 4 | Taste (gustation) | Chemical composition of substances (sweet, sour, salt, bitter, umami) |
| 5 | Touch (pressure) | Mechanical pressure on skin |
| 6 | Temperature (thermoception) | Heat and cold |
| 7 | Pain (nociception) | Tissue damage / harmful stimuli |
| 8 | Balance (vestibular) | Gravitational orientation, acceleration |
| 9 | Proprioception | Body position, limb location in space |
| 10 | Vibration | Mechanical oscillations (via Pacinian corpuscles) |
| 11 | Spatial awareness | 3D positioning relative to environment |

**Debatable / internal state (NOT true external sensors):**
- Time perception — memory/pattern recognition, not a sensor
- Hunger — internal hormone signaling (ghrelin), not external detection
- Thirst — internal osmotic balance monitoring
- Fatigue — internal energy state
- Itch — variant of pain/touch response

## The Numbers

**Sensor categories vs specific sensors:**
The ~50 number represents **distinct sensing modalities** — categories of what you're detecting. Within each category there are hundreds or thousands of specific sensor implementations. For example, "camera" is one modality but there are thousands of different image sensors. "Gas detection" is one modality but there are hundreds of sensors for different chemical compounds (MQ-2 for methane, MQ-3 for alcohol, MQ-7 for CO, etc). If you count every specific sensor variant ever manufactured, the number is in the **tens of thousands**. But they all fall into roughly 50-70 categories of "what type of thing are you detecting."

The 50 listed here covers every commercially available sensing category. There are likely more in exotic physics labs, classified military applications, and experimental research — potentially pushing the total to 60-70 distinct modalities.

**Fundamental sensing dimensions:**
- Humans sense ~4 fundamental things: electromagnetic radiation (light), mechanical waves (sound/touch/balance), chemicals (smell/taste), and gravity
- A fully loaded Phoenix Pandant senses those same 4 plus: ionizing radiation, magnetic fields, electrical fields, spectral composition, ultrasonic, and precise geolocation — roughly **8-10 fundamental dimensions**
- The large/lab sensors add: subatomic particles, gravitational waves, molecular structure, genetic code — pushing to ~15 fundamental dimensions

## Summary
- Humans have ~11 true external senses (4 fundamental dimensions)
- Phoenix v1 has 2 sensors (camera + mic)
- Phoenix fully loaded could have 22 sensors — all wearable on chest (8-10 fundamental dimensions)
- Total known sensing categories: ~50-70
- Total specific sensor implementations: tens of thousands
- A fully loaded Phoenix Pandant: 22 out of ~50-70 categories
