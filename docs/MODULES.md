# Phoenix — Docking Modules

Phoenix's Pandant is the core — always on you, always sensing. But its capabilities expand through docking modules — small specialized stations that Phoenix connects to (magnetically or via USB-C) to gain additional sensing abilities.

## Why Docking Modules Need Phoenix

The modules work independently — they have their own sensors and could technically function alone with their own screen via Bluetooth. Phoenix doesn't physically do the analysis. So what does Phoenix add?

**Phoenix is the brain, the memory, and the interface. The module is just hands.**

1. **Interface** — results show on Phoenix's screen, Phoenix speaks them to you, you ask questions conversationally
2. **Memory** — Phoenix stores every result, tracks trends over weeks/months, notices gradual changes you'd never catch ("your inflammation marker has been rising slowly for 3 weeks")
3. **AI correlation** — Phoenix combines data from ALL its sources. Blood data alone is useful. Blood data + sleep patterns + environmental data + activity + air quality = a complete picture

**Example:**
> "Hey Phoenix, why do I feel tired today?"
>
> "Your CO2 was high in your bedroom last night, your sleep was restless based on accelerometer data, and your hemoglobin has been trending down for 2 weeks. You might want to eat more iron-rich foods and open your window at night."

No single device could give that answer. Only Phoenix — with blood data, environmental sensors, motion data, and AI memory of your history — can correlate across all sources and give you an actual explanation.

Without Phoenix, each module is just another disconnected gadget showing you a number. With Phoenix, every data point feeds into a unified AI that knows your whole picture and can reason about it.

## Module 1: Blood Analysis Dock

### Concept (Basic — €30-35, matchbox-sized)
A small module using lensless microscopy for cell-level blood imaging. Good for cell counts, bacteria detection, and visual abnormalities.

### Concept (Advanced — €100-120, bread-loaf-sized)
A full personal blood lab that checks most of what your doctor checks annually — cholesterol, hormones, inflammation, liver/kidney function — using reagent strips, spectrophotometry, and fluorescence detection. Daily testing. Results in 2-3 minutes. Sits on your desk, Phoenix docks in magnetically or connects via Bluetooth.

### How It Works (Basic — Lensless Microscopy)
A matchbox-sized module that turns Phoenix into a personal blood lab. Prick your finger, put a drop of blood on the sample slot, Phoenix analyzes it using AI image recognition through a lensless microscope.

### How Lensless Microscopy Works
No traditional lens or optics. The blood sample sits directly on a bare image sensor chip with an LED light source above it. The raw sensor image looks like shadows and diffraction patterns — not a traditional microscope image. Computational algorithms (running on Phoenix's ESP32 or offloaded to phone/server) reconstruct a magnified image from these patterns.

This technology is proven — research groups at UCLA (Ozcan Lab) and Caltech have built fingertip-sized lensless microscopes achieving 1-2 micron resolution.

### What 1-2 Micron Resolution Can See
| Target | Size | Detectable? |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Red blood cells | ~7 microns | Yes — shape, count, abnormalities |
| White blood cells | ~10-15 microns | Yes — count, type differentiation |
| Platelets | ~2-3 microns | Yes — count |
| Bacteria | ~1-5 microns | Yes — presence, rough identification |
| Parasites (malaria etc.) | ~1-15 microns | Yes |
| Cancer cells | ~10-20 microns (abnormal shape/size) | Potentially — AI pattern recognition |
| Blood sugar crystallization | Varies | Potentially — experimental |

### Hardware
| Component | Size | Cost |
|-----------|------|------|
| Lensless microscope image sensor | 5x5mm | €10-15 |
| LED light array | 2mm | €1 |
| Microfluidic sample chip (disposable) | Credit card thin | €0.20 each (€10 for 50 pack) |
| 3D printed housing | ~30x30x15mm | Free (own printer) |
| Lancets (finger prick) | Standard | €5 for 100 pack |
| **Total module cost** | Matchbox-sized | **€30-35** |

### How It Works
1. Slide Phoenix Pandant onto the blood dock (magnetic alignment)
2. Phoenix detects the dock, switches to blood analysis mode on screen
3. Prick finger with lancet
4. Touch blood drop to the microfluidic sample chip in the dock
5. LED illuminates the sample from above
6. Lensless microscope sensor captures diffraction pattern
7. Phoenix's ESP32 captures image, sends to phone/server
8. AI reconstructs microscope image and analyzes:
   - Cell counts (RBC, WBC, platelets)
   - Cell morphology (shape abnormalities)
   - Foreign bodies (bacteria, parasites)
   - Anomalous cells (potential cancer markers)
9. Results displayed on Phoenix's screen in seconds
10. Pop out used microfluidic chip, dispose, slot new one

### Why This Matters
| Traditional Blood Test | Phoenix Blood Module |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Once a year (maybe) | Every single day |
| Wait days for results | Seconds |
| €50-100 per test | €0.20 per test (disposable chip) |
| Requires doctor visit | At home, anywhere |
| Single snapshot in time | Daily trend tracking over months/years |
| Human lab technician reads results | AI reads results — consistent, never tired, pattern recognition across thousands of samples |

The real power is **daily monitoring**. A single blood test is a snapshot. Daily testing with AI trend analysis over months can detect:
- Gradual white blood cell count changes → early infection or immune response
- Slow red blood cell shape changes → developing anemia
- Unusual cell appearance → early cancer detection before symptoms
- Bacterial presence → infection caught days earlier than symptoms would show
- Response to diet/medication changes → see what actually works

### Design Considerations
- **Sanitary:** Disposable microfluidic chips ensure no cross-contamination. Each test uses a fresh chip.
- **Biohazard:** Used chips contain blood — need proper disposal guidance (small sharps/biohazard container included with chip packs)
- **Calibration:** AI model needs training data — partner with labs that have large databases of blood cell images with known diagnoses
- **Regulatory:** This is technically a medical device. For personal use/research = fine. For selling with medical claims = needs FDA/CE certification (expensive, long process). Selling as "educational/research tool, not for medical diagnosis" avoids this initially.
- **Accuracy:** Won't replace a full CBC (complete blood count) from a hospital lab. But for daily trend monitoring and anomaly flagging ("something changed, go see a doctor"), it's more than sufficient.

### Advanced Module Hardware (€100-120, bread-loaf-sized)

Additional components beyond the basic lensless microscope:

| Component | What It Does | Cost |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| Spectrophotometer (colorimetric) | Reads reagent strip color changes — cholesterol, glucose, hemoglobin, protein | €20-30 |
| Electrochemical sensor array | Sodium, potassium, calcium, blood pH | €15-20 |
| UV fluorescence reader | Detects hormones and proteins via immunoassay strips | €15-20 |
| Tiny centrifuge | Separates blood into plasma (where cholesterol/hormones live) and cells | €10-15 |
| Higher resolution image sensor | Sharper cell imaging for better AI analysis | €10 |

### What the Advanced Module Detects

| Health Marker | Method | Lab Cost Per Test |
|--------------|--------|-------------------|
| Cholesterol (HDL, LDL, total) | Reagent strip + spectrophotometer | €30-50 |
| Blood glucose | Reagent strip (same as diabetic meters) | €1 |
| Hemoglobin / anemia | Colorimetric analysis | €20-30 |
| Testosterone | Immunoassay strip + fluorescence | €50-80 |
| Cortisol (stress hormone) | Immunoassay strip + fluorescence | €40-60 |
| Thyroid (TSH) | Immunoassay strip + fluorescence | €40-60 |
| CRP (inflammation) | Immunoassay strip | €30-40 |
| Vitamin D | Immunoassay strip + fluorescence | €40-60 |
| Liver enzymes (ALT, AST) | Reagent strip + spectrophotometer | €30-50 |
| Kidney function (creatinine) | Reagent strip | €20-30 |
| White/red blood cell count | Lensless microscope + AI | €20-30 |
| Bacteria/infection | Microscope + AI pattern recognition | €30-50 |

**How reagent strips work:** Paper strips pre-loaded with chemicals that react with specific blood components. They change color proportionally to concentration. Camera + AI reads the color intensity and converts to a number. Same principle as pregnancy tests and glucose meters — just expanded to more markers.

**Immunoassay strips** detect hormones (testosterone, cortisol, thyroid). They use antibodies that bind to specific hormones and produce a fluorescent signal readable by the UV fluorescence sensor. Cost: €1-3 per strip at scale.

### Cost
- **Module hardware:** €100-120 (one-time)
- **Monthly consumables:** €10-20 (reagent strips, microfluidic chips, lancets)
- **Per test cost:** ~€0.50-1.00
- **Replaces:** €200-500+ in annual lab work

### Daily Routine
Wake up → prick finger → slot strip into module → Phoenix reads it while you make coffee → results on screen + stored in memory → AI tracks trends → alerts you if anything changes significantly
