# Phoenix Tool Registry

Phoenix is a compilation of the best available tools. All we do is take what they create and integrate it.
This document tracks what's installed, what's next, and what the Scout discovers.

## In Progress

| Tool | Category | What it does | % | Blocker |
|------|----------|-------------|---|---------|
| Piper Voice Training | Voice | Custom TTS voice clone from user recordings | 50% | Training data ready (274 segments). Docker or native pip needed. |
| Resistance Router | Routing | Multi-path action execution with learning | 90% | Needs real-world usage data to tune weights |
| Email Provider | Comms | Outbound email for compose/notify — initEmail() exists, no provider configured | 0% | Pick provider (Resend, SES, etc.) and wire credentials |
| Pendant Firmware | Hardware | ESP32-S3 Sense: camera, mic, BLE, sensors | 30% | Hardware in dev, BLE protocol designed |
| Geofencing (zones.js) | Presence | Location-aware permission gating | 50% | zones.js wired, GPS source integration pending |
| Personal Sync | Data | Sync across Phoenix instances (home ↔ laptop) | 40% | startPersonalSync() exists, conflict resolution pending |
| Identity System | Presence | Multi-modal identity from visual + voice + context | 40% | Schema designed (see docs/FEATURES.md), matching algorithm pending |

## Next Up — Approved for Integration

| Priority | Tool | Category | Why | URL |
|----------|------|----------|-----|-----|
| 1 | **yt-dlp** | Media | Download video/audio from any platform via CLI. Phoenix says "download this" and it just works. | https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp |
| 2 | **Groq** | AI | 300-400ms TTFT target for voice router. Needs API key. | https://groq.com |
| 3 | **WebSocket for phone dashboard** | Comms | Replace 3s polling with real-time push. Eliminates phone transcript race condition (#376). | — |

## Potential — Scouted, Not Yet Evaluated

| Tool | Score | Category | What it does | URL |
|------|-------|----------|-------------|-----|
| Aganium | 0.92 | Agent | DNS-like discovery for AI agents, mTLS trust, capability search | https://github.com/Aganium/aganium |
| AgentHotspot | 0.88 | MCP | Marketplace for MCP connectors — discover + install dynamically | https://github.com/AgentHotspot/agenthotspot-mcp |
| Adala | 0.72 | Agent | Autonomous data labeling with learning capabilities | https://github.com/HumanSignal/Adala |
| AgentForge | 0.68 | Agent | Low-code multi-LLM agent framework | https://github.com/DataBassGit/AgentForge |
| streamlink | 0.60 | Media | Extract streams from websites, pipe to player | https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink |
| mpv | 0.50 | Media | Scriptable video player with CLI remote control | https://mpv.io |

## Evaluated & Rejected

| Tool | Reason |
|------|--------|
| CMUX | macOS-only (Swift/AppKit). Phoenix already has terminal management. |
| NemoClaw (NVIDIA) | Enterprise-focused agent sandbox. Too heavy for personal use. |
| RunPod Flash | Cloud GPU — costs money per second. Only useful for one-time training. |
| Gemini Nano ML Kit | `Generation.getClient()` hangs indefinitely on Pixel 10 Pro. Beta API, not stable. Server-side Cerebras is faster anyway. |
| Phi 3.5 Mini (on-device) | Replaced by Cerebras free tier — faster, smarter, no local resource cost. |
| Browser Extension | Replaced by Playwright MCP. More reliable, no Chrome extension restrictions. |

## Future Vision

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Data Staking** | Phoenix captures everything. Users stake their data for AI training, get paid. See docs/DATA-DIVIDENDS.md. |
| **Skill Marketplace** | Skills anyone can write and share — already started with skill-learner.js. |
| **BLE Mesh** | Pendants communicate nearby presence without server. See docs/BLE-MESH.md. |
| **Agent Network** | Via Aganium — Phoenix discovers and calls other agents' tools across a network. |
| **Home Assistant** | Phoenix + HA integration for smart home control. See docs/HOME-ASSISTANT.md. |
