/**
 * ConversationTracker — determines if speech is directed at Phoenix without requiring a trigger word.
 *
 * Every transcribed chunk runs through evaluate() which returns a Decision:
 *   COMMAND  — clearly a command for Phoenix, route immediately
 *   RESPOND  — Phoenix is being spoken to conversationally, respond
 *   AMBIENT  — not for Phoenix, save as context but stay quiet
 *
 * Logic:
 *   1. Direct address: mentions Phoenix by name → COMMAND or RESPOND
 *   2. Follow-up: last Phoenix interaction was recent → assume continuation
 *   3. Imperative: "open X", "create X", "do X" with no other conversation partner → COMMAND
 *   4. Question: asked while in conversation with Phoenix → RESPOND
 *   5. Everything else → AMBIENT
 *
 * The tracker maintains a conversation window. Once Phoenix is addressed, it stays
 * "in conversation" for CONVERSATION_TIMEOUT_MS. During that window, all speech
 * is assumed to be for Phoenix unless it's clearly not (e.g., talking to someone else).
