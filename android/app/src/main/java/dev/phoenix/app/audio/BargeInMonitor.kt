/**
 * BargeInMonitor — detects user speech during TTS playback.
 *
 * Core idea: attach Android's hardware AcousticEchoCanceler (AEC) to the AudioRecord
 * session. AEC is designed for phone calls — it removes the speaker signal from the mic
 * so you don't hear yourself echo. Same principle here: TTS plays through the speaker,
 * AEC subtracts it from the mic input at hardware level. Only the user's voice remains.
 * A simple RMS threshold then detects "someone spoke" reliably.
 *
 * We don't need voice identity — we just need to cancel the AI voice out.
 * AEC does that without any ML, at near-zero CPU cost.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *  1. Open AudioRecord + attach AEC (+ NoiseSuppressor if available)
 *  2. Calibrate ambient RMS for 400ms (should be ~0 after AEC strips TTS)
 *  3. Watch for CONSECUTIVE windows above threshold → fire onBargeIn()
 *
 * Fallback: if AEC unavailable, falls back to raw mic with higher threshold.
