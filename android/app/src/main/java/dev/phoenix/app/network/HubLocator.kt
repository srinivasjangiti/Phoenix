/**
 * Finds the Phoenix hub instead of assuming where it is.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-10):
 * The hub moved from the Dell to the mini PC and the phone went dark for nine
 * days. 192.168.1.248 was hardcoded in four Kotlin files, and
 * RemoteAccessManager._serverTailscaleHost — the one variable designed to hold
 * this — defaulted to "" and was never called by anything.
 *
 * It was also unrecoverable from the phone: the hub cannot push a new address
 * to a device that does not know where the hub is, and the phone exposes no
 * inbound port (verified over the tailnet — every port closed, no ICMP, no
 * device record). One wrong constant meant an APK rebuild.
 *
 * Resolution order, first that answers /health wins:
 *   1. lastGood      — whatever worked last time, persisted across launches
 *   2. tsnet proxy   — RemoteAccessManager's 127.0.0.1:<port> tunnel
 *   3. MagicDNS      — "phoenix-hub". Move the hub to another machine, rename that
 *                      machine in Tailscale, every client follows. No rebuild.
 *   4. LAN fallbacks — for when Tailscale is down on the same network
 *
 * Whatever answers is also asked /api/v1/hub-address, so a stale instance can
 * redirect us to the real hub rather than quietly serving an old database.
 *
 * SYNCHRONOUS ON PURPOSE. This is called from an OkHttp Interceptor, which is
 * blocking and already runs off the main thread. A suspend API would force
 * runBlocking at the call site, which is strictly worse.
